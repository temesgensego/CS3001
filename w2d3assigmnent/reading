One-letter variables 

The Dao hides in wordlessness. Only the Dao is well begun and well completed. 

Another way to code shorter is to use single-letter variable names everywhere. Like a, b or  

Use abbreviations 

If the team rules forbid the use of one-letter and vague names – shorten them, make abbreviations. 

Like this: 

list → lst. 

userAgent → ua. 

browser → brsr 

Soar high. Be abstract. 

The ideal name for a variable is data. Use it everywhere you can. Indeed, every variable holds data 

Name a variable by its type: str, num… 

Attention test 

Only a truly attentive programmer should be able to understand your code. But how to check that? 

One of the ways – use similar variable names, like date and data. 

Smart synonyms 

For instance, consider function prefixes. If a function shows a message on the screen – start it with display…, like display Message. And then if another function shows on the screen something else, like a user name, start it with show… (like showName). 

Reuse names 

Once the whole is divided, the parts 
need names. 
There are already enough names. 
One must know when to stop

Overlap outer variables 

When in the light, can’t see anything in the darkness.

Side-effects everywhere!
